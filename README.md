I downloaded and obfuscated some ATM transaction data for 7-2020 to 8-2021 for one of my ATMs at a hotel. 
 
In this repo there are a few things
 
1. The raw data `Obfuscated ATM data.csv`. This contains information about the datetime, the amount requested, if the transaction was approved, metadata about the transaction, and a unique customer identifier.
  
2. `Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb`. Notebook with analysis on the frequency, distribution and characteristics of the transaction data.
