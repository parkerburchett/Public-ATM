I downloaded and obfuscated some ATM transaction data for 7-2020 to 8-2021 for one of my ATMs at a hotel. 
 
In this repo there are a few things
 
1. The raw data `Obfuscated ATM data.csv`. This contains information about the datetime, the amount requested, if the transaction was approved and an obfuscated unique customer identifier.
  
  
2. `Analysis.ipynb`. This notebook cleans the raw data and then does some analysis on the relationship between time of day, weekday and repeat customers.(not finished)
